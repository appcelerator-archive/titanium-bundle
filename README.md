titanium-bundle
===============

A pseudo npm package that is used to easily install the suite of all community node.js Titanium packages

To install the CLI, alloy, and the code processor, type:

```
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:appcelerator/titanium-bundle
```

Once the package has been installed, run

```
./node_modules/titanium-bundle/bin/install.js
```

You may need to run the previous command as sudo, depending on your setup. Once done, you should have the master version of all three packages installed.
